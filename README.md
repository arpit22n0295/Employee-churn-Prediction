# 📊 Project Title: Employee Churn Prediction


👋 Greetings! I'm Arpit Arya, a dedicated MSc Physics student at IIT Bombay. Step into the world of predictive analytics with me as we unveil the secrets of employee churn through data-driven exploration!


🔍 Project Overview:
In today's ever-evolving corporate landscape, understanding employee churn is paramount. Join me on this journey as we dive deep into predictive insights, fueled by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.


🔍 Data Exploration:
🔎 I've meticulously dissected the "HR_Analytics" dataset, using Plotly and Seaborn to breathe life into each of the nine features. These visuals aren't just pretty – they're key to unraveling hidden relationships and trends, allowing our models to flourish.



🔮 Unveiling Clustering:
🔮 K-Means clustering, an unsupervised marvel, was our first attempt. Bolstered by the elbow method, it was an enlightening experiment even though it didn't yield our ultimate goal. It paved the way for what lay ahead.



⚙️ Machine Learning Models:
Determined to capture churn patterns with precision, I unleashed a battalion of models:

🌲 Robust Random Forest

🚀 Gradient-Boosted GB Classifier

🔍 Insightful K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

🐱 Innovative Cat Boost Classifier


🎛️ Hyperparameter Tuning:
In the relentless pursuit of perfection, I tinkered with hyperparameters, fine-tuning our models for optimal performance. It's all about squeezing every ounce of predictive power out of our algorithms.



📈 Performance Evaluation:
📈 Armed with a plethora of metrics – F1-score, recall, and accuracy – I subjected our models to a rigorous showdown. The victor? The GB Classifier, reigning with an astounding 98.5% accuracy. A testament to its prowess in deciphering churn intricacies.




🚀 Future-Ready:
🚀 Each model, a masterpiece of optimization, was encapsulated using Pickle – future-proofed and ready for action. As I unveil this project on GitHub, I'm excited to share my insights, code, and journey with the world.




🔗 Join the Journey:
If the realm of employee churn prediction beckons, if you yearn to hone your data analysis finesse, or if you simply crave a peek into the magic of turning data into wisdom, I extend a warm invitation. Collaboration, insights, and camaraderie – let's make this journey memorable.
